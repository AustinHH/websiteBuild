# websiteBuild
This is my first website ive built and fully understood!
The home page of the website can be found in the index.html
There is also a blog page titled blog.html
all the css for both pages are in starbuzz.css
everything else is just the video and images needed!

hope you like my first site!

*note images were used in the header and elsewhere on the page
*the code was written with them in a folder titled images
*becuase of this all images are sourced 'src="images/nameOfImage.gif"
*to make the site display properly youll need to put the images in a folder titled images
*or simply delete the "images/"from code!
